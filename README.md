# Introduction to Learning Bash Script

Learning **Bash Script** is an important first step for anyone looking to master automation of tasks in Linux or Unix operating systems. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is one of the most popular shells used across Linux distributions, and scripting with Bash allows users to execute a series of commands automatically, efficiently, and repeatably.

##### üí™ In learning Bash Script, we will all learn the basics of writing scripts, such as;

* Basic Syntax
* Variables
* loops
* branching (if-else)
* functions
* as well as how to manage files, directories, and processes.

 We will also learn how to build scripts that can handle user input, read log files, and run administrative tasks such as backups, system updates, or application installations automatically.

##### üí° In learning Bash Script, we will all learn the Intermediate of writing scripts.
We will now explore mid-level scripting while continuing our exploration of Bash Script.
At this point, we will investigate more useful and automated tasks such as:

* Creating scheduled backups
* Cleaning up old files automatically
* Monitoring system resources
* Logging user activity
* Managing and inspecting services
* Perform batch file operations

These scripts will help us hone our Bash skills and get ready for real-world use cases in automation, DevOps workflows, and system administration.
